This is also related to the archival principles of &lt;a href="https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/physical-control.html">physical&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://dictionary.archivists.org/entry/intellectual-control.html">intellectual control&lt;/a> of collections. This report inspired many archival institutions to begin surveying their collections for born-digital media as a basic starting point to approaching born-digital processing. The trend included multiple rounds of &lt;a href="https://www2.archivists.org/groups/manuscript-repositories-section/jump-in-initiative-0">SAA&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Jump-in&amp;rdquo; initiative&lt;/a> which encouraged repositories to do surveys and share their results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Where I work, the MIT Libraries, for various reasons, did not do a survey or partake in the Jump-in initiatives. There were efforts to survey some collections but there wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything comprehensive. At the same time, there was some transfer of material off of digital media found in collections. So we weren&amp;rsquo;t walking or jumping but we would do random sprints and then collapse into a crawl, gasping for breath while working on other projects that came along.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In recent years, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked to formalize our &lt;a href="https://wikis.mit.edu/confluence/x/8xmuC">procedures for transferring content&lt;/a> off of born-digital physical media and I feel like we&amp;rsquo;re in a good place to do that work for common media types. In 2019, I began the start of work for a media survey but was delayed due to the pandemic (surprise!). When I regained the ability to access the collections again in fall 2021, I began the survey work in earnest.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goals">Goals&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In starting this work I have a few goals for what we hope to get out of it. As you might expect, I want to figure out what media we have and where it is! Beyond this simple knowledge, doing this work will give us a more holistic understanding of the media in our collection that can inform our future processing efforts, appraisal, staffing, and what equipment we may need. While all of this media is at some level of risk remaining stored in these formats, knowing the collections that contain the media can help us take an EDISJ approach in prioritizing the transfer of content by and about white women and people of color of all genders.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="looking-for-leads">Looking for leads&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We started the survey process by developing a list of terms related to digital media, which we could then search for in our ArchivesSpace repository and create a report from the API with: Floppy, Floppies, Disc, Discs, Disk, Disks, Diskette, Diskettes, CD, CDs, CD-rom, CD-roms, DVD, DVDs, USB, Hard drive, Flash drive, Digital, Zip, Data tape, Data tapes, Thumb drive, Backup, Backups, Cartridge, Cartridges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Using this list we ended up with a pretty long CSV of possible elements within finding aids and accessions to investigate. To make this list a little more manageable, I separated out the terms that were the result of just searching &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo; to possibly work on at a later stage of the process, as these would most like contain the most false positives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started going through the remaining list for any false positives or duplicate entries. We ended up with 545 entries, which isn&amp;rsquo;t that solid of a number as in many cases I can&amp;rsquo;t tell whether description is in aggregate or an item level. I used formulas to total up the frequency per search term and the number of results per archival collection which I can use as a starting point to figure out which collections to call first. I then took the paired down list and bulk imported them into an Aeon &amp;ldquo;activity&amp;rdquo; for eventually requesting their boxes from storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-to-record-survey-results">How to record survey results&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In planning for this survey we needed a method to record our results once the boxes are called from storage and we get that sweet plastic, magnetic, and optical substrate into our hands. That&amp;rsquo;s where the media log will come in!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Archivists at other institutions developed multiple media logs (&lt;a href="https://github.com/NYULibraries/medialog">NYU&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://github.com/RockefellerArchiveCenter/dm_log">Rockefeller Archive Center&lt;/a>, for instance) for similar situations as us, recording the presence of digital media in collections, it&amp;rsquo;s type, and whether the content has been migrated to a more accessible medium. These other instances caught the eye of staff members here years ago and we had &lt;a href="https://github.com/MITLibraries/adml">a version that was spun up for us&lt;/a> (but rewritten in Java, not sure why&amp;hellip;). The app sat largely unused since that time, when the pandemic started it was fully taken offline due to a need of a infrastructure migration and the realization that it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be used for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of the survey prep we decided to get the app running again because it seemed like it would fit our needs. This took a little while with some support from staff in digital library services but we&amp;rsquo;re back up and running. We made some minor additions for things that might be useful like label info and categories of media that weren&amp;rsquo;t present but the app largely remains similar.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="next-steps">Next steps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With all this geared up, we were hoping to get started with actually &lt;em>doing&lt;/em> the survey at the start of this new year but with the pandemic raging I&amp;rsquo;ve been fully working from home this past month. Delayed again! But what can you do? Before going remote again, I already had done some calculations based on the number of boxes I&amp;rsquo;m allowed to call to campus (we use offsite storage), the number of days I work on campus during a week, and the time to do the survey against the time remaining and it would be impossible to finish by the end of the fiscal year (when I wanted to complete the survey).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So even with the month delay, things were already a bit behind. I&amp;rsquo;m ready to push ahead with the actual survey regardless of the time it takes and hope to share some more updates along the way!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A short look @ Kids dot US, a failed public/private web experiment [for kids]</title><link>https://carrano.org/2021/08/kids-dot-us/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 20:26:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://carrano.org/2021/08/kids-dot-us/</guid><description>&lt;p>A little while ago I went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole and ended up at the the Wikipedia article for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.us">.us domain&lt;/a>. I was particularly intrigued by the section for Kids.us. Have you heard of it? I know I had no idea what it was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the Wikipedia article states, it was a subdomain of the .us domain made specifically for kids and created by U.S. law! Through an act of Congress in 2002, lawmakers created the subdomain to be used by content providers to create kid-centric websites. It never really took off and by the end there were only 6 active websites left on the subdomain: Nick, NickJr, PBSkids, Smithsonian, and two identical sites selling trampolines.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This peaked my interest. What were these websites like? Was there any more information out there? Why did the U.S. government ever think this was a good idea?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="birthing-a-subdomain">Birthing a subdomain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the early 2000s, just as today, politicians were &lt;em>concerned&lt;/em> about kids on the internet. Especially how sites were using common word web domains to host pornography, which many people, including children, would stumble upon accidentally. A bipartisan group of lawmakers felt the solution would be to create a domain where there would only be appropriate content for children, which many of them described akin to the &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rsquo;s section of a library&amp;rdquo; but of course probably never spoke to a children&amp;rsquo;s librarian.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original idea was to create a new TLD (top-level domain) called dot kids (.kids) but there was some controversy over the US throwing its weight around to impose US law to a domain that would be used internationally and also the bill&amp;rsquo;s sponsors felt it would take ICANN forever to actually deliberate on whether they would agree to create this for them. In light of this, the focus switched to an area more under US control, the .us domain.&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So as mentioned above, they created an act (the Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002) and the kids dot us subdomain (.kids.us) was born. The law tasked the company under contract with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Telecommunications_and_Information_Administration">NTIA&lt;/a> to administer the .us domain at the time, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neustar">Neustar&lt;/a>, to manage the subdomain and the content moderation of the sites that registered.&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="we-have-rules">We have rules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Neustar started up the service and got a decent amount of registrants but not a lot of &lt;code>#content&lt;/code>. It was pretty strict what could go on the site - no external hyperlinks (a walled garden), no &amp;ldquo;two-way and multi-user interactive services&amp;rdquo; (email, chat, etc.), nothing that would break existing laws, plus no: mature content, pornography, inappropriate language, violence, hate speech, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, ambling, weapons, and criminal activity. In order finance the administration of these rules, each registration came with a hefty price tag plus a &amp;ldquo;content approval fee&amp;rdquo;, which in turn probably stifled demand combined with the already stringent content rules.&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="were-the-kids-of-the-dot-us-woah">We&amp;rsquo;re the kids of the dot US (woah)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At its peak, Kids dot US only had about 24 active websites, a far cry from what the crafters of the act that established it envisioned. The main kids.us site indexed these pages on the homepage. Most just consisted of Flash games which included hyperlinks, i.e. violated the rules, directing users to the download the required software (safest software out there at the time!). There also seemed to be a bunch of sites that had links to outside sites but they weren&amp;rsquo;t hyperlinked, so really any kid who learned copy/paste would be well on their way to the big bad internet.&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Kids dot US shutdown officially in 2012 and an education advisory group set to the task of evaluating whether it was worth it to keep it going in some way. Spoiler alert: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. &lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The limited scope of the subdomain makes it an ideal use case if someone wanted to do research on what went on there from a number of perspectives. It could be something similar to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00799-016-0202-6">the study of another short lived domain, Yugoslavia (.yu)&lt;/a>, or something different entirely! Take a look at the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403142136/http://www.kids.us/sitelist.html?catALL">archived 2005 site&lt;/a> of the index (around the time with the peak number if sites) either in Wayback or Oldweb.today (for flash!) and enjoy the ride.&lt;/p>

I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to break ground on a new website for myself that&amp;rsquo;s more under my control and at my own domain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m moving away from my old site &lt;a href="https://josephcarrano.wordpress.com">josephcarrano.wordpress.com&lt;/a> and casting it into the abandoned graveyard. In recent years, I&amp;rsquo;ve been loath to create new posts not only because I&amp;rsquo;m lazy but also because I hate the thought of publishing content to URLs that could easily break.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite this worry, I won&amp;rsquo;t be migrating content at the moment or setting up redirects because I don&amp;rsquo;t feel like paying WordPress for the redirect service and it&amp;rsquo;s simple enough to leave it there neglected as it has been for the last few years. I&amp;rsquo;m mainly leaving it up in the interest of preventing link rot on the few posts that people found useful. If you want to check out the posts there, they should remain as long as wordpress.com remains free and functioning online. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll reconsider this later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to post a little bit more now. As much as once or twice a year even! And if you&amp;rsquo;re interested, you&amp;rsquo;ll find that content here.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
