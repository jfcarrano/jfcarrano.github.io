In that time there have been a couple of domain name switches but it&amp;rsquo;s been pretty boring considering the scope and tragedy of the ongoing pandemic.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In June, I was reviewing some of our crawl reports for this seed and I noticed an unusual url in the host report: archive.org, i.e. the big brother of Archive-It, THE (with no respect to Ohio State) Internet Archive. Obviously, this shouldn&amp;rsquo;t happen unless the site was actually linking out to IA.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some investigation, I found that there were a few links to IA! &lt;em>It&amp;rsquo;s web archives all the way down.&lt;/em> The strange thing was that the links were on the MIT Travel policy page, pointing to information from &lt;a href="https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/traveladvisories/traveladvisories.html/">the Department of State&lt;/a> and &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html">the CDC&lt;/a> (under &amp;ldquo;Additional Resources&amp;rdquo;) that is still actively maintained and people would need the most up-to-date information about. Instead, they were getting pandemic related travel info from late March!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Checking out the &lt;a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/7963/*/https://now.mit.edu/policies/mit-travel-policy/">Archive-it Wayback captures for the MIT travel page&lt;/a>, I saw that this change happened around May 11. You can see the proper links on &lt;a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/7963/20220509093052/https://now.mit.edu/policies/mit-travel-policy/">May 9&lt;/a> but then those links are removed on &lt;a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/7963/20220511014346/https://now.mit.edu/policies/mit-travel-policy/">May 11&lt;/a> and then added back in &lt;a href="https://wayback.archive-it.org/7963/20220511205440/https://now.mit.edu/policies/mit-travel-policy/">later in the day&lt;/a>, but replaced with IA Wayback links. Weird! For their part, I was able to find the maintainers of the website and they fixed the links pretty quickly.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They didn&amp;rsquo;t tell me how this might of occurred but we can speculate a couple scenarios:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Somebody accidently deleted those links when updating the website and had to go into IA out of ease or necessity to find what was there before. They then did a simple copy+paste instead of editing out the Wayback url prefix. In any event, maintain backups!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Or some link checking plug-in went awry and inserted a Wayback link in place of the original links, due to an error saying the page was no longer available (temporary 404, etc.).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Either way, the result was that the content was made to look outdated or old, kind of like how you can distress a piece of furniture to make it look vintage. I&amp;rsquo;m not about to yuck anyone&amp;rsquo;s yum but neither of those things are for me. While there was no ill intent here, you can see how easy it is to spread misinformation this way, especially if people aren&amp;rsquo;t looking closely. The pandemic isn&amp;rsquo;t over and people need up-to-date information to inform their decisions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Link rot is a real problem and web archives have a place to play in mitigating that in information resources. However, current information shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be replaced by a snapshot of something in time. If we&amp;rsquo;re going to insert archived links into web pages either manually or via automation, the solutions to display them are already out there such as &lt;a href="https://robustlinks.mementoweb.org/">robust links&lt;/a>, where you can display both a current link and a web archived version very easily. You&amp;rsquo;ve then got the up-to-date info and a web archived link just in case. Make your links robust, not distressed!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A short look @ Kids dot US, a failed public/private web experiment [for kids]</title><link>https://carrano.org/2021/08/kids-dot-us/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Aug 2021 20:26:29 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://carrano.org/2021/08/kids-dot-us/</guid><description>&lt;p>A little while ago I went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole and ended up at the the Wikipedia article for the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.us">.us domain&lt;/a>. I was particularly intrigued by the section for Kids.us. Have you heard of it? I know I had no idea what it was.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the Wikipedia article states, it was a subdomain of the .us domain made specifically for kids and created by U.S. law! Through an act of Congress in 2002, lawmakers created the subdomain to be used by content providers to create kid-centric websites. It never really took off and by the end there were only 6 active websites left on the subdomain: Nick, NickJr, PBSkids, Smithsonian, and two identical sites selling trampolines.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This peaked my interest. What were these websites like? Was there any more information out there? Why did the U.S. government ever think this was a good idea?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="birthing-a-subdomain">Birthing a subdomain&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the early 2000s, just as today, politicians were &lt;em>concerned&lt;/em> about kids on the internet. Especially how sites were using common word web domains to host pornography, which many people, including children, would stumble upon accidentally. A bipartisan group of lawmakers felt the solution would be to create a domain where there would only be appropriate content for children, which many of them described akin to the &amp;ldquo;children&amp;rsquo;s section of a library&amp;rdquo; but of course probably never spoke to a children&amp;rsquo;s librarian.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The original idea was to create a new TLD (top-level domain) called dot kids (.kids) but there was some controversy over the US throwing its weight around to impose US law to a domain that would be used internationally and also the bill&amp;rsquo;s sponsors felt it would take ICANN forever to actually deliberate on whether they would agree to create this for them. In light of this, the focus switched to an area more under US control, the .us domain.&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So as mentioned above, they created an act (the Dot Kids Implementation and Efficiency Act of 2002) and the kids dot us subdomain (.kids.us) was born. The law tasked the company under contract with &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Telecommunications_and_Information_Administration">NTIA&lt;/a> to administer the .us domain at the time, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neustar">Neustar&lt;/a>, to manage the subdomain and the content moderation of the sites that registered.&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="we-have-rules">We have rules&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Neustar started up the service and got a decent amount of registrants but not a lot of &lt;code>#content&lt;/code>. It was pretty strict what could go on the site - no external hyperlinks (a walled garden), no &amp;ldquo;two-way and multi-user interactive services&amp;rdquo; (email, chat, etc.), nothing that would break existing laws, plus no: mature content, pornography, inappropriate language, violence, hate speech, drugs, alcohol, tobacco, ambling, weapons, and criminal activity. In order finance the administration of these rules, each registration came with a hefty price tag plus a &amp;ldquo;content approval fee&amp;rdquo;, which in turn probably stifled demand combined with the already stringent content rules.&lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="were-the-kids-of-the-dot-us-woah">We&amp;rsquo;re the kids of the dot US (woah)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>At its peak, Kids dot US only had about 24 active websites, a far cry from what the crafters of the act that established it envisioned. The main kids.us site indexed these pages on the homepage. Most just consisted of Flash games which included hyperlinks, i.e. violated the rules, directing users to the download the required software (safest software out there at the time!). There also seemed to be a bunch of sites that had links to outside sites but they weren&amp;rsquo;t hyperlinked, so really any kid who learned copy/paste would be well on their way to the big bad internet.&lt;sup id="fnref:8">&lt;a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> &lt;sup id="fnref1:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kids dot US shutdown officially in 2012 and an education advisory group set to the task of evaluating whether it was worth it to keep it going in some way. Spoiler alert: it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. &lt;sup id="fnref2:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The limited scope of the subdomain makes it an ideal use case if someone wanted to do research on what went on there from a number of perspectives. It could be something similar to &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s00799-016-0202-6">the study of another short lived domain, Yugoslavia (.yu)&lt;/a>, or something different entirely! Take a look at the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20050403142136/http://www.kids.us/sitelist.html?catALL">archived 2005 site&lt;/a> of the index (around the time with the peak number if sites) either in Wayback or Oldweb.today (for flash!) and enjoy the ride.&lt;/p>
