<a href=/tags/link-rot>link rot</a><p><div>At work I&rsquo;ve been crawling some form of the MIT COVID-19 response webpage daily since early March 2020. In that time there have been a couple of domain name switches but it&rsquo;s been pretty boring considering the scope and tragedy of the ongoing pandemic.
In June, I was reviewing some of our crawl reports for this seed and I noticed an unusual url in the host report: archive.org, i.e. the big brother of Archive-It, THE (with no respect to Ohio State) Internet Archive.

<a href=/tags/survey>survey</a><p><div>In Ricky Erway&rsquo;s foundational instructional guide, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve Got to Walk Before You Can Run: First Steps for Managing Born-Digital Content Received on Physical Media&rdquo;, we learn that &ldquo;walk&rdquo; in this context means to know about the physical media that you have in your collection, the where, the how much, and the what type. This is also related to the archival principles of physical and intellectual control of collections. This report inspired many archival institutions to begin surveying their collections for born-digital media as a basic starting point to approaching born-digital processing.

<a href=/tags/web-archives>web archives</a><p><div>A little while ago I went down a Wikipedia rabbit hole and ended up at the the Wikipedia article for the .us domain. I was particularly intrigued by the section for Kids.us. Have you heard of it? I know I had no idea what it was.
As the Wikipedia article states, it was a subdomain of the .us domain made specifically for kids and created by U.S. law! Through an act of Congress in 2002, lawmakers created the subdomain to be used by content providers to create kid-centric websites.

<a href=/tags/introductions>introductions</a><p><div>Hi there! I&rsquo;ve decided to break ground on a new website for myself that&rsquo;s more under my control and at my own domain.
I&rsquo;m moving away from my old site josephcarrano.wordpress.com and casting it into the abandoned graveyard. In recent years, I&rsquo;ve been loath to create new posts not only because I&rsquo;m lazy but also because I hate the thought of publishing content to URLs that could easily break.
Despite this worry, I won&rsquo;t be migrating content at the moment or setting up redirects because I don&rsquo;t feel like paying WordPress for the redirect service and it&rsquo;s simple enough to leave it there neglected as it has been for the last few years.
