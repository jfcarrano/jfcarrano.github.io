Hi! I’m Joe Carrano. This is my personal professional site. I'm a digital archivist at MIT Libraries where I work on saving both old and new bits for future generations. Previously, I was the [National Digital Stewardship Resident](http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/ndsr/documents/GUL_Proposal_Redacted.pdf) at Georgetown University Library. I have a B.A. in history and  political science from the University of Connecticut and dual master’s degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park, one in Library Science focusing on Archives and one in History focusing on U.S. History. The site you're on serves mainly as a place to put some (infrequent) blog posts on archives, history, and the digital world. If interested, stay and read more or contact me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/joecar25) or [digipres.club](https://digipres.club).
